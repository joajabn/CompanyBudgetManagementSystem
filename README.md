## Project Overview
The Company Budget Management System allows users to:
- Set and track company budgets.
- Divide budgets into multiple categories (e.g., HR, IT, Marketing).
- Add expenses to categories and monitor them against the budget.
- Receive warnings when expenses exceed 90% of the allocated budget.
- Securely manage and access budget data through a RESTful API.

## Features
- **CRUD Operations for Budgets and Expenses**: Users can create, read, update, and delete budgets and expenses.
- **Budget and Expense Comparison**: Automatically compares budgeted amounts with actual expenses.
- **Category-Wise Expense Tracking**: Expenses are categorized into pre-defined types such as HR, IT, Marketing, etc.
- **Real-Time Alerts**: Alerts when the total expenses or a categoryâ€™s expenses exceed 90% of the allocated budget.
- **Database**: Data is stored in a relational database (MySQL).

[//]: # (- **Secure Access Control**: Role-based access control using Spring Security &#40;users, managers, etc.&#41;.)

[//]: # (- **Database & Caching**: Data is stored in a relational database &#40;MySQL&#41;, and caching is implemented to improve performance.)

## Technologies Used
- **Backend Framework**: Spring Boot
- **Database**: MySQL
- **Security**: Spring Security
- **Mapping**: MapStruct
- **Testing**: JUnit, Spring Boot Test
- **Validation**: Hibernate Validator
- **Logging**: SLF4J

## System Architecture
The application follows a layered architecture:
1. **Controller Layer**: Exposes RESTful endpoints for budget and expense management.
2. **Service Layer**: Handles business logic, including budget validation, expense tracking, and alert generation.
3. **Repository Layer**: Interacts with the database to persist and retrieve budgets, categories, and expenses.

[//]: # (4. **Security Layer**: Manages user authentication and role-based authorization.)

## Setup Instructions

### Prerequisites
- Java 17
- Maven
- MySQL database
- IDE like IntelliJ IDEA or Eclipse

### Steps to Run Locally
1. **Clone the repository**:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/joajabn/CompanyBudgetManagementSystem.git
    ```

2. **Set up the database**:
    - Create a MySQL database.
    - Update the `application.properties` file with your database connection details.
    ```properties
    spring.datasource.url=jdbc:mysql://localhost:8080/budget_management
    spring.datasource.username=root
    spring.datasource.password=password
    spring.jpa.hibernate.ddl-auto=update
    ```

    ```

4. **Run the application**:
    ```bash
    mvn spring-boot:run
    ```

5. **Access the application**:
    - The API should now be running at `http://localhost:8080`.
